**Project: Drone Tracking Robot Arm**

**Goal:**
A drone tracking robot arm. The physical arm will be constructed using the AX-12A servos, "Trossen" robot package. 
Computer vision will be used to track the movement of a drone with onboard aruco tags, and the arm will reposition itself so that it is pointing towards the drone. 

**Impact**
This will augment the human ability to record video footage of fast moving objects from one place to another, thereby improving safety and efficiency in many industrial scenarios and beyond.
